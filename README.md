# log.beta

## Welcome!

This repo only contains the draft API for experimentation. That is, no backing implementation.

If you just want to try out the API or maybe do your own thing you can currently snag it from jitpack. Maven Central
publishing can be done upon request.

If this doesn't work out - after beta comes gamma.
